Installation
------
Installation

```
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml

or ./ansible.sh
```



Requirements
-------------

As there's no public repository available, you'll need to download Spectrum Scale (GPFS) packages from the IBM website. Visit https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral and search for 'IBM Spectrum Scale (Software defined storage)'.

Local Spectrum Scale Repo
-------
To created a local repo on a web server:

```
cd /your/webserver/folder
# Download the Spectrum Scale install files. get directlink or copy it into your server 
wget ------Spectrum Scale Binary -----
sh ./Spectrum_Scale_Data_Management-5.0.X.X-x86_64-Linux-install --dir ./SpectrumScaleRpms/5.0.X.X/ --silent
yum install -y createrepo
cd SpectrumScaleRpms/5.0.X.X/
createrepo .
```


Role Variables
--------------

Default variables are defined in defaults/main.yml in every rolse. You'll also find detailed documentation in that file. Define your own host variables in your inventory to override the defaults.

Defining the variable scale_version is mandatory. 
- Furthermore, you'll need to configure an installation method by defining one of the following variables:
    - `scale_install_repository_url:` this needs to pointed to `zimon_rpms` folder, as orginal library from download cant find the correct packages.
 
Role Dependencies
----

core role needs to be executed first. but we can also execute only gui role if core  cluster is already exists.

Example Playbook
----------------

The simplest possible playbook to install Spectrum Scale on a node with GUI:

```
---
- hosts: scale01.example.com
  vars:
    - scale_version: 5.0.4.0
    - scale_install_localpkg_path: /path/to/Spectrum_Scale_Standard-5.0.4.0-x86_64-Linux-install
  roles:
    - core/precheck
    - core/node
    - core/cluster
    - gui/precheck
    - gui/node
    - gui/cluster
```

This will install all required packages and create a single-node Spectrum Scale cluster with GUI.

In reality you'll most probably want to install Spectrum Scale on a number of nodes, and you'll also want to consider the node roles in order to achieve high-availability. The cluster will be configured with all hosts in the current play:

```
# host_vars/scale01:
---
scale_storage:
  - filesystem: gpfs01
    blockSize: 4M
    defaultMetadataReplicas: 2
    defaultDataReplicas: 2
    numNodes: 16
    automaticMountOption: true
    defaultMountPoint: /mnt/gpfs01
    disks:
      - device: /dev/sdb
        nsd: nsd_1
        servers: scale01
        failureGroup: 10
        usage: metadataOnly
        pool: system
      - device: /dev/sdc
        nsd: nsd_2
        servers: scale01
        failureGroup: 10
        usage: dataOnly
        pool: data
    
    scale_nodeclass:
      - class1
    scale_config:
      - nodeclass: class1
        params:
          - pagepool: 2G
          - autoload: yes
          - ignorePrefetchLunCount: yes
scale_cluster_gui: true
```
```
# host_vars/scale02:
---
scale_storage:
  - filesystem: gpfs01
    disks:
      - device: /dev/sdb
        nsd: nsd_3
        servers: scale02
        failureGroup: 20
        usage: metadataOnly
        pool: system
      - device: /dev/sdc
        nsd: nsd_4
        servers: scale02
        failureGroup: 20
        usage: dataOnly
        pool: data
scale_cluster_gui: true  ##Dual/HA GUI
```


- For more information check out man pages and https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/STXKQY/ibmspectrumscale_welcome.html



All the variable below can be added to **host_vars/host:**  on the node you want to be GUI node. 
For the Second GUI node, you only needs to have `scale_cluster_gui: true`

E-Mail Recipients Parameters
--------
- To add E-mail Recipients the scale_gui_email_notification need to be configured.
  Add all of the parameters change them to your environment. See example below.


**Options:**  
- **NAME**: Name of the email Recipients

- **Address:** userAddress Specifies the address of the e-mail user

- **Components_security_level**
   - The value `scale_gui_email_recipients_components_security_level: ` Need to contain the **Component** and the **Warning/Security Level**
        - Chose component like **SCALEMGMT** and the security_level of WARNING wil be **SCALEMGMT=ERROR**
        - Security level: Chose the lowest severity of an event for which you want to receive and email.  Example, selectin Tip includes events with severity Tip, Warning, and Error in the email.
        - The Severity level is as follows: : **INFO**, **TIP**, **WARNING**, **ERROR**

    List of all security levels:
    ```
    AFM=WARNING,AUTH=WARNING,BLOCK=WARNING,CESNETWORK=WARNING,CLOUDGATEWAY=WARNING,CLUSTERSTATE=WARNING,DISK=WARNING,FILEAUDITLOG=WARNING,FILESYSTEM=WARNING,GPFS=WARNING,GUI=WARNING,HADOOPCONNECTOR=WARNING,KEYSTONE=WARNING,MSGQUEUE=WARNING,NETWORK=WARNING,NFS=WARNING,OBJECT=WARNING,PERFMON=WARNING,SCALEMGMT=WARNING,SMB=WARNING,CUSTOM=WARNING,AUTH_OBJ=WARNING,CES=WARNING,CESIP=WARNING,NODE=WARNING,THRESHOLD=WARNING,WATCHFOLDER=WARNING,NVME=WARNING,POWERHW=WARNING
    ```

- **Reports**  listOfComponents 
    - Specifies the components to be reported. The tasks generating reports are scheduled by default to send a report once per day. Optional.

    ```

- **quotaNotification**
   Enables quota notifications which are sent out if the specified threshold is violated. (See --quotathreshold)

- **quotathreshold**  valueInPercent
    - Sets  the  threshold(percent  of the hard limit)for including quota violations in the quota digest report.  
    - The default value is 100. The values -3, -2, -1, and zero have special meaning. 
    - Specify the value -2 to include all results, even entries where the hard quota not set. 
    - Specify the value -1 to include all entries where hard quota is set and current usage is greater than or equal to the soft quota.
    - Specify the value -3 to include all entries where hard quota is not set and current usage is greater than or equal to the soft quota only. 
    - Specify the value 0 to include all entries where the hard quota is set.

 Using unlisted options can lead to an error.  

**Example:** scale_gui_email_recipients
```
scale_gui_email_recipients:
  name: 'name_email_recipient_name'
  address: 'email_recipient_address@email.com'

  ip_adress: 'snmp_server_host'
  ip_port: '162'
  community: 'Public'
```


HasiCorp Integration - HTTPs Certificate from Vault.
------
- Generate https Certificate from HasiCorp Vault and import it to Scale GUI. 
- The Scale host need to be included in Hasi Vault and the Ansible playbook need to have the **computed.name** variables, normaly the playbook is then run from Terraform to get values. 

Change the values to true to enable the https certificate import.
 ```
 scale_gui_cert_hc_vault: true
 ```
 


Limitations
-----------

This role can (currently) have some limitation so that running it on existing environment it maybe fail.  


Troubleshooting
---------------

To get output from Ansible task in stdout and stderr for some tasks. add  `scale_gui_ansible_task_output: true` in your host var.

This role stores configuration files in `/var/tmp` on the first host in the play. These configuration files are kept to determine if definitions have changed since the previous run, and to decide if it's necessary to run certain Spectrum Scale commands (again). When experiencing problems one can simply delete these configuration files from `/var/tmp` in order to clear the cache &mdash; this will force re-application of all definitions upon the next run. As a downside, the next run may take longer than expected as it might re-run unnecessary Spectrum Scale commands. Doing so will automatically re-generate the cache.

If you experience  "msg": "Unable to start service gpfsgui: Job for gpfsgui.service failed because a timeout was exceeded. See \"systemctl status gpfsgui.service\" and \"journalctl -xe\" for details.\n"}`
this is mostly cause by Performance issue in your environments like overcommitment on your hypervisors, if the Service takes to long time to start the systemd times out, try to rerun the playbook.
