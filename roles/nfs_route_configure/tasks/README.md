**OS level Route for CES Cluster**

The purpose is to allow traffic between the compute and client subnet with the protocol and storage subnet. This involves setting up custom IP routes, routing tables, IP rules, and ensuring the necessary configurations for network communication between these subnets. The playbook performs checks and configurations to enable this.
