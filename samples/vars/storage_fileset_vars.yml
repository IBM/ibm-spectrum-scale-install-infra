# Refer to `man mmchfs` and `man mmchnsd` man pages for a description of these
# storage parameters. The `filesystem` parameter is mandatory, `servers`, and
# the `device` parameter is mandatory for each of the file system's `disks`. All
# other file system and disk parameters are optional.

# Important:
# `scale_storage` *must* be define using group variables. Do *not* define disk
# parameters using host variables or inline variables in your playbook. Doing so
# would apply them to all hosts in the group/play, thus defining the same disk
# multiple times...

# In the below example, we will create two filesets: binaries and data. The binaries 
# fileset will have a quota of 0, meaning it has no storage allocation limit, while 
# the data fileset will have a quota of 50 GB

scale_storage:
  - filesystem: gpfs01
    filesets:
      binaries: 0
      data: 50
    disks:
      - device: /dev/sdb
        nsd: nsd_1
        servers: scale01
        failureGroup: 10
        usage: metadataOnly
        pool: system
      - device: /dev/sdc
        nsd: nsd_2
        servers: scale01
        failureGroup: 10
        usage: dataOnly
        pool: data
