#

# Playbook sample for deploying IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS) cluster with Remote_Mount no GUI on client Cluster
# enabled. Additional variables need to be defined for this, it is recommended
# to use Ansible group variables for this purpose:
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#assigning-a-variable-to-many-machines-group-variables

# Following example will connect up to the first host in your ansible host file, and then run the playbook and do API Call to Storage Cluster.
# So in this case the Client Cluster node need access on https/443 to Storage Cluster GUI Node.
