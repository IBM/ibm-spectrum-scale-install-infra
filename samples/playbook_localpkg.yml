# samples/playbook_localpkg.yml
#

# Playbook sample for deploying IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS) cluster using local
# archive installation method. This means that the self-extracting archive
# containing the Spectrum Scale code is accessible on the Ansible control
# machine running the playbook. Integrity of the archive will be validated by
# comparing checksums with a *.md5 reference file (if present), the archive will
# be copied to each managed node in your cluster
# ('scale_install_localpkg_tmpdir_path'), and subsequently the archive will be
# extracted. Packages will then be installed from the local files on each node.

# Note that specifying the variable 'scale_version' is mandatory for this
# installation method.
