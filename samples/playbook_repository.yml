# Playbook sample for deploying IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS) cluster using
# repository installation method. You will need to provide the URL of an
# (existing) Spectrum Scale YUM repository. Copy the contents of
# /usr/lpp/mmfs/{{ scale_version }}/* to a web server to build your repository.
# A YUM repository will be defined on each managed node in your cluster.
# Packages will then be installed from this central repository.

# Note that specifying the variable 'scale_version' is mandatory for this
# installation method.
