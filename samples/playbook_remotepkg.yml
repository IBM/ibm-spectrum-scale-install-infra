#

# Playbook sample for deploying IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS) cluster using remote
# archive installation method. This means that the self-extracting archive
# containing the Spectrum Scale code is accessible on each Ansible managed node.
# Integrity of the archive will be validated by comparing checksums with a *.md5
# reference file (if present), and subsequently the archive will be extracted.
# Packages will then be installed from the local files on each node.

# Note that specifying the variable 'scale_version' is mandatory for this
# installation method.
