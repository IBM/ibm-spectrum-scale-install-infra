Coding Practices
----------------

- Ansible
  - Get started with [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_getting_started.html#getting-started)
  - Practice [Ansible configuration language](https://www.ansible.com/use-cases/configuration-management)

- Indent by two spaces

- Always use pure YAML &mdash; i.e. write this:

  ```
  copy:
    src: /srv/myfiles/foo.conf
    dest: /etc/foo.conf
  ```

  ...not this:

  ```
  copy: src=/srv/myfiles/foo.conf dest=/etc/foo.conf
  ```

- Only quote if necessary:

  * String starts with a YAML control character: `-`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `*`, `&`, `?`, `|`, `>`, `!`, `%`, <code>&#96;</code>, `#`, `@`, `:`

  * String contains colon `:` followed by space

  * String is boolean value (`yes`, `false`, ...) which should be preserved as string

  * String in Jinja2 / `when:` / `until:` statement

- Adhere to following order of declarations:

  ```
  - name: tag | Task description
    vars:
      var-1: ...
      var-2: ...
    task:
      task-param-1: ...
      task-param-2: ...
    notify: ...
    register: ...
    when: ...
    with_items: ...
    run_once: ...
    delegate_to: ...
    delegate_facts: ...
    changed_when: ...
    failed_when: ...
  ```

Sign Your Work for Submittal
----------------------------

It is required to sign your work before you submit a pull request. The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the description for the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from https://developercertificate.org/)...

```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
1 Letterman Drive

San Francisco, CA, 94129

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

...then you just add a line to every git commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>
```
Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

Note: If your git config information is set properly then viewing the git log information for your commit will look something like this:

```
Author: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 2 11:41:15 2018 -0800

    docs: Update README

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>
```

Notice the Author and Signed-off-by lines match. If they don't your PR will be rejected.
