IBM Spectrum Scale supported versions
-------------------------------------

Currently, the following IBM Spectrum Scale versions are supported: 5.0.4.0, 5.0.4.1, 5.0.4.2,....

Prerequisites
-------------

- #### Install Ansible on any node (controller node)
    ```
    $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    $ python get-pip.py --user
    $ pip install --user ansible
    ```

    For detailed installation procedure, refer to [Installing Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

- #### Download IBM Spectrum Scale packages
 1. A free Developer Edition trial available at this site:
    https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-41728
       
 2. Customers who have previously purchased Spectrum Scale can obtain entitled versions from IBM Fix Central:
    Visit https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral and search for 'IBM Spectrum Scale (Software defined storage)'.
    

- #### Create password-less SSH keys between all GPFS nodes in the cluster
    A pre-requisite for installing IBM Spectrum Scale is that passwordless SSH must be configured among all
    nodes in the cluster. Passwordless SSH must be configured and checked with FQDN, hostname, and IP of 
    every node to every node. 
    Example:
    
    ```
    ssh-keygen
    ssh-copy-id -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no node1.gpfs.net
    ssh-copy-id -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no node1
    ssh-copy-id -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no

    repeat for all nodes to themselves and to all other nodes
    ```

Installation instructions
-------------------------

- #### Clone `ibm-spectrum-scale-install-infra` repository to your controller node on which Ansible is installed.
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/IBM/ibm-spectrum-scale-install-infra.git
    ```

- #### Change working directory to `ibm-spectrum-scale-install-infra`
    ```
    cd ibm-spectrum-scale-install-infra/
    ```
- #### Create inventory
 1. Define GPFS nodes in the hosts file in the following format
      ```
      # hosts:
      [cluster01]
      scale01  scale_cluster_quorum=true   scale_cluster_manager=true scale_cluster_gui=false
      scale02  scale_cluster_quorum=true   scale_cluster_manager=true scale_cluster_gui=false
      scale03  scale_cluster_quorum=true   scale_cluster_manager=false scale_cluster_gui=false
      scale04  scale_cluster_quorum=false  scale_cluster_manager=false scale_cluster_gui=false
      scale05  scale_cluster_quorum=false  scale_cluster_manager=false scale_cluster_gui=false

      ```
      Variables used in the above hosts file
      
      - `[cluster01]` : User defined host groups for GPFS cluster nodes on which
        GPFS installation will take place.

      - `scale_cluster_quorum`: User defined node designation for GPFS quorum. It
        can be either true or false.

      - `scale_cluster_manager`: User defined node designation for GPFS manager. It
        can be either true or false.

      - `scale_cluster_gui`: User defined node designation for GPFS GUI. It
        can be either true or false.

      ---
      **NOTE:**
      Defining node roles such as `scale_cluster_quorum` and `scale_cluster_manager` is optional. If you do not specify any quorum nodes then the first seven hosts in your inventory are automatically be assigned the quorum role.

      ---
 2. To create NSDs, file systems and node class in the cluster you'll need to provide additional information. It is  recommended to use the `group_vars` inventory file as follows:

      ```
      # group_vars/all:
      ---
      scale_storage:
        - filesystem: gpfs01
          blockSize: 4M
          defaultMetadataReplicas: 2
          defaultDataReplicas: 2
          numNodes: 16
          automaticMountOption: true
          defaultMountPoint: /mnt/gpfs01
          disks:
            - device: /dev/sdb
              nsd: nsd_1
              servers: scale01
              failureGroup: 10
              usage: metadataOnly
              pool: system
            - device: /dev/sdc
              nsd: nsd_2
              servers: scale01
              failureGroup: 10
              usage: dataOnly
              pool: data
      ```

      Refer to `man mmchfs` and `man mmchnsd` man pages for a description of these storage parameters.

      The `filesystem` parameter is mandatory, `servers`, and the `device` parameter is mandatory for each of the file system's `disks`. All other file system and disk parameters are optional. Hence, a minimal file system configuration would look like this:

      ```
      # group_vars/all:
      ---
      scale_storage:
        - filesystem: gpfs01
          disks:
            - device: /dev/sdb
              servers: scale01
            - device: /dev/sdc
              servers: scale01,scale02
      ```

      > **Important**: `scale_storage` *must* be define using `group_vars` inventory files. Do *not* define disk parameters using `host_vars` inventory 
      files or inline `vars:` in your playbook. Doing so would apply them to all hosts in the group/play, thus defining the same disk multiple times...

      Furthermore, Spectrum Scale node classes can be defined on a per-node basis by defining the `scale_nodeclass` variable:
      
      ```
      # host_vars/scale01:
      ---
      scale_nodeclass:
        - classA
        - classB
      ```
      ```
      # host_vars/scale02:
      ---
      scale_nodeclass:
        - classA
        - classC
      ```

      These node classes can optionally be used to define IBM Spectrum Scale configuration parameters. It is suggested to use `group_vars` inventory files for that purpose:

      ```
      # group_vars/all:
      ---
      scale_config:
        - nodeclass: classA
          params:
            - pagepool: 16G
            - autoload: no
            - ignorePrefetchLUNCount: yes
      ```

      Refer to the `man mmchconfig` man page for a list of available configuration parameters.

      Note that configuration parameters can be defined as variables for *any* host in the play &mdash; the host for which you define the configuration parameters is irrelevant.

 3. To install callhome and configure callhome in the cluster you'll need to provide additional information. It is  recommended to use the `group_vars` inventory file as follows:
      ```
      # group_vars/all.yml:
      ---
      callhome_params:
       is_enabled: true
       customer_name: abc
       customer_email: abc@abc.com
       customer_id: 12345
       customer_country: IN
       proxy_ip:
       proxy_port:
       proxy_user:
       proxy_password:
       proxy_location:
       callhome_server: host-vm1
       callhome_group1: [host-vm1,host-vm2,host-vm3,host-vm4]
       callhome_schedule: [daily,weekly]
      ```
- #### Modify playbook.yml

  The basic playbook.yml looks as follows:
  ```
  # playbook.yml:
  ---
  - hosts: cluster01
    vars:
      - scale_version: 5.0.4.0
      - scale_install_localpkg_path: /path/to/Spectrum_Scale_Standard-5.0.4.0-x86_64-Linux-install
    roles:
      - core/precheck
      - core/node
      - core/cluster
      - gui/precheck
      - gui/node
      - gui/cluster
      - zimon/precheck
      - zimon/node
      - zimon/cluster
      - callhome/precheck
      - callhome/node
      - callhome/cluster
      - callhome/postcheck
  ```   
  ---
  **NOTE:**
  
  Defining the variable `scale_version` is mandatory. Furthermore, you'll need to configure an installation method
  by defining *one* of the following variables:

   - `scale_install_repository_url` (eg: http://infraserv/gpfs_rpms/)
   - `scale_install_remotepkg_path` (accessible on Ansible managed node)
   - `scale_install_localpkg_path` (accessible on Ansible control machine)
  
  The following installation methods are available:
  
   - Install from (existing) YUM repository(`scale_install_repository_url`)
   - Install from remote installation package (`scale_install_remotepkg_path`)
   - Install from local installation package (`scale_install_localpkg_path`)
   
  ---

- #### Run the playbook to install and configure the GPFS cluster
   - Using the ansible-playbook command:
      ```
      $ ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
      ```
   - Using the Ansible automation script:
      ```
      ./ansible.sh
      ```   
     ---
      **NOTE:**
      An advantage of using the Ansible automation script is that it will generates log files based on the date and the time
      in the `/tmp` directory.

Optional Role Variables
-----------------------
User can also define some of the following variables to override default values:

- `scale_cluster_clustername`      : User defined GPFS cluster name.
- `scale_prepare_disable_selinux`  : SELinux can be disabled. It can be either true or false.(By default, it is false)
- `scale_prepare_disable_firewall` : Firewall can be disabled. It can be either true or false.(By default, it is true)

IBM Spectrum Scale Roles
--------------------

If you are assembling your own IBM Spectrum Scale playbook, these roles are available for you to reuse:

- [core gpfs](./roles/core)
- [gpfs gui](./roles/gui)
- [gpfs callhome](./roles/callhome)

Cluster Membership
------------------

All hosts in the play are configured as nodes in the same cluster. If you want to add hosts to an existing cluster then add at least one node from that existing cluster to the play.

You can create multiple clusters by running multiple plays.


Limitations
-----------

These role can (currently) be used to create new clusters or extend existing clusters. Similarly, new file systems can be created or extended. But this role does *not* remove existing nodes, disks, file systems or node classes. This is done on purpose. This is also the reason why it can not be used, for example, to change the file system pool of a disk. Changing the pool requires you to remove and then re-add the disk from a file system, which is not currently in the scope of this role.

Furthermore, upgrades are not currently in scope of this role. Spetrum Scale supports rolling online upgrades (by taking down one node at a time), but this requires careful planning and monitoring and might require manual intervention in case of unforeseen problems.


Troubleshooting
---------------

This role stores configuration files in `/var/tmp` on the first host in the play. These configuration files are kept to determine if definitions have changed since the previous run, and to decide if it's necessary to run certain IBM Spectrum Scale commands (again). When experiencing problems one can simply delete these configuration files from `/var/tmp` in order to clear the cache &mdash; Doing this forces re-application of all definitions upon the next run. As a downside, the next run may take longer than expected as it might re-run unnecessary IBM Spectrum Scale commands. Doing so will automatically re-generates the cache.
